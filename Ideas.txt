	IDEAS:
		
		- Have a plane trail (spawn a circle at the back of the plane, and then make it smaller and fade away)
		- Have a choose plane option at main menu
		- Have plane go towards cursor unless left button clicked(creates target)
		- If right button clicked, make target the mouse cursor again(used to dodge enemies)
		- Keep plane moving in direction of target or instantly move target back to mouse
		- Variable speeds between 1 - 2
		- UI Sounds
		- Hover over button sound effect and visual effect
		- 3D clickable buttons
		- total points earned on end screen
		- maybe have ammo that you can pick up and use
		- possible button class (making it easier to draw and way less code)
			- if button.Pressed()
		- have player be able to pick plane and colour of plane at menu
		- enemies be a certain colour that cant be picked by player (black probably)
		- maybe a new class where it randomly picks a start and end position for the enemy planes
		- press escape during gameplay
			- pause game and have a quit, resume, restart, options
		- make plane smoke darker as you lose health
		- maybe have a screen bounds class
			- boundries
			- if .IsOffScreen
			- use for spawning enemies and making targets

	Enemy Ideas:
		- Planes flying across the screen randomly
		- People or things on the ground shooting up at my plane
		- My plane able to shoot at other planes, or drop bombs on ground units
		- Maybe an upgrade menu and point system
		- Some sort of coin collecting objective, flag retrieving, package dropping... etc.
		- maybe use a class for enemy planes (maybe part of a class for user plane aswell)
		- points ("100") appearing every kill or coin gotten moving up left
		- damage ("30") appearing every hit to enemy moving down right
		- shoot with 2 bullets every couple seconds ( - -              - -                - - )

	Menu Screen: 
		- start button, quit game button, keybinds settings, choose plane button
		- ability to change keybinds(maybe)
		- ability to change sound levels(maybe)
		- maybe a how-to-play button that shows keybinds

	Upgrade Menu:
		- Boost upgrades (duration, maybe speed)
		- Ammo(bullets, maybe max capacity)
		- Health
		- Bombs
		- hover over for info on what each does
		- if not enough points, give them a warning about not enough points
		- make into own screen


	Things to do:
		- Enemies(getting there)
		- Bombs(getting there)
		- Intro and outro screens
		- Improve UI and add onto button class(sounds)
		- Add subtle engine sound effect
		- Move trail into trail class(adding cirlces to list)
		- Tell user when they have hit the maximum for any upgrade
		- Move all timers into a list
		- health boost pickups or maybe healing stations
