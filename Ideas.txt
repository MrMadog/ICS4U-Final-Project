	IDEAS:
		
		- Have a plane trail (spawn a circle at the back of the plane, and then make it smaller and fade away)
		- Have a choose plane option at main menu
		- Have plane go towards cursor unless left button clicked(creates target)
		- If right button clicked, make target the mouse cursor again(used to dodge enemies)
		- Keep plane moving in direction of target or instantly move target back to mouse

		enemy ideas:
			- planes flying across the screen randomly
			- people or things on the ground shooting up at my plane
			- my plane able to shoot at other planes, or drop bombs on ground units
			- maybe an upgrade menu and point system
			- some sort of coin collecting objective, flag retrieving, package dropping... etc.
