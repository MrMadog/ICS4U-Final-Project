	IDEAS:
		
		- Have a plane trail (spawn a circle at the back of the plane, and then make it smaller and fade away)
		- Have a choose plane option at main menu
		- Have plane go towards cursor unless left button clicked(creates target)
		- If right button clicked, make target the mouse cursor again(used to dodge enemies)
		- Keep plane moving in direction of target or instantly move target back to mouse
		- Variable speeds between 1 - 2
		- UI Sounds
		- Hover over button sound effect and visual effect
		- 3D clickable buttons
		- points ("+100") appearing every kill or coin collected moving up left
		- damage ("30") appearing every hit to enemy moving down right 
		- total points earned on end screen

	Enemy Ideas:
		- Planes flying across the screen randomly
		- People or things on the ground shooting up at my plane
		- My plane able to shoot at other planes, or drop bombs on ground units
		- Maybe an upgrade menu and point system
		- Some sort of coin collecting objective, flag retrieving, package dropping... etc.
		- maybe use a class for enemy planes (maybe part of a class for user plane aswell)

	Menu Screen: 
		- start button, quit game button, keybinds settings, choose plane button
		- ability to change keybinds
		- maybe a how-to-play button that shows keybinds
